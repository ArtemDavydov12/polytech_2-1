The wave runs to this shore
The wave is running and something is delirious.
And the stars are falling outside the gate
And the bucket in the sky is overturned.
And thoughts were mixed in my head
And barefoot with a bottle of whiskey.
We're exploring this shore
The wave is running and something is delirious.
There is sand and stones around the water,
And measuring time in sips,
And everyone around, like the wind blew away,
We were attracted like a magnet.
To each other and now to the shore,
The wave is running and something is delirious.
And the stars are falling outside the gate
And the bucket in the sky is overturned.
Another sip and we burn
One, two, three.
Then do not wait and do not miss,
Burn your third Rome with fire,
Catch my rhythm.
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance.
We were strangely close
By taking one potion of poison.
Now we take whiskey
And thoughts mixed in my head.
Around the water, sand and stones
And time, measuring in sips.
We're exploring this shore
The wave is running and something is delirious.
I want to sleep and not wake up
To go to the seas and not return.
Or will they only return together
It's so much more interesting with you.
There are so many interesting things with you
It's not crowded around at all,
Without the squares of train stations, stations,
Without all these civilizations.
Another sip and we burn
One, two, three.
Then do not wait and do not miss,
Burn your third Rome with fire,
Catch my rhythm.
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance.
Dance, the wave runs to the shore
The wave is running and something is wandering.
Dance, the star flies out the gate
And the bucket in the sky is overturned.
Dance, thoughts are mixed in your head
Pass a bottle of whiskey.
Pass a bottle of poison
We don't need anything else.
We don't need anything else
Whiskey whirls, whirls, whirls.
I'm not close here with you anymore,
And the ladle in the sky fell into place.
Pass a bottle of whiskey
And you read my mind.
And the stars are falling outside the gate
And the bucket in the sky is overturned.
Another sip and we burn
One, two, three.
Then do not wait and do not miss,
Burn your third Rome with fire,
Catch my rhythm.
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance.
Another sip and we burn
One, two, three.
Then do not wait and do not miss,
Burn your third Rome with fire,
Catch my rhythm.
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance.
